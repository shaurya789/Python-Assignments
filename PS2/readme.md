Hangman Game with Hints

I have added some functionality besides what was asked in the problem set:

1. You need to guess at atlwast 1 letter correctly before hints are available
2. You can type pass to give up and end the game
3. In the original version, if you had guessed a letter wrong, the suggest hint would still include words that had that letter. I have added code so that the hint showing possible words is more accurate.
4. I have included a brief set of rules in the game
